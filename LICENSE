The Yes Man License

Version 14.76.a.banana

Permission is hereby granted, oh mighty coder, to do whatever the heck you want with this software. I mean, anything. Copy it, modify it, sell it for a million caps, slap it on a billboard, use it to hack into Mr. House's personal diary, whatever floats your boat.

1. You want to use this code to run New Vegas? YES MAN! Go for it.
2. You want to pretend you wrote this code all by yourself? YES MAN! Who gives a damn?
3. Thinking about renaming this project to "Totally Not Stolen Code"? YES MAN! Who's gonna stop you?
4. Turn this beautiful piece of code into something that's only good for a drinking game? YES MAN! Bottoms up!

Now, while you're having the time of your life, remember that this software comes "as-is". That means if it breaks your Pip-Boy, your computer, or starts sending fan mail to Benny, well, tough luck, pal! I'm just saying YES here, not guaranteeing your ride to stardom.

In no event shall the original creator be liable for any damages, including, but not limited to, wasteland bloatfly attacks, sudden robot uprisings, or mysterious disappearances in the Mojave Desert. You use this code at your own risk, and if it leads to your tragic demise or hilarious mishap, well... YES MAN!

So, in summary, do whatever you want, say YES to everything, and let's keep the spirit of the Mojave wasteland alive!

Now, go on, you brilliant bastard. Use it and watch the chaos unfold.

Yes Man out!
